This file was generated by using "grep" to filter for lines containing "echo" or "read -p"
invocations, such that you may you use the exact verbiage in your script.
For example, this was the command line used to make this file (notwithstanding a small
amount of manual cleanup/formatting at the end):

	for f in *.bash; do echo -e "\n$f:"; \grep -e echo -e "read -p" "$f"; done > a1_strings.txt
